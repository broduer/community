### Section-specific instructions

Instructions for maintaining specific sections of the website.

#### Adding user stories

User stories are located under `content/outreach/stories`.

To add a new user story, add a new directory with the story's pseudonymous name. In that directory two files are required, `portrait.png` and `contents.lr` containing the story text.

For the portrait, generate one manually from the [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/) [OpenPeeps illustration library](https://www.openpeeps.com/). A portrait from another story may also be re-used.

For the story content, the `contents.lr` file should be formatted as follows:

```
---
_model: story
---
html: outreach-story.html
---
section: Stories
---
section_id: stories
---
title: <title>
---
category:

<category>
---
summary: <summary>
---
body:

<body>
```

Replace the placeholders as follows:

 - `<title>`: Capitalized pseudonymn for this story
 - `category`: one or more of `activism`, `anti-censorship`, `civic-participation`, `encryption`, `freedom-of-information`, `healthcare`, `lgbtqia`, `online-safety`, `preace-of-mind`, `press-freedom`, `privacy` (as defined in `databags/story-categories.ini`), one category per line
 - `<summary>`: text shown on the index page below the portrait (one or two short phrases)
 - `<body>`: full story content (the first paragraph will be automatically "featured")

These steps can be done directly in the GitLab Web IDE: simply create a new branch, enter the editor environment, create the directory, add/edit the needed files and finally, create and push a new commit. GitLab will then offer the option to create a merge request. Once the MR is created, a "review app" will be deployed allowing to preview the changes.

#### Adding training guides for training resources

Each training resource can optionally have a training guide. You can create a training guide for a particular resource by creating a new lektor contents file with the path `content/training/resources/<resource name>-guide/contents.lr`. So to create a guide for a resource called `all-about-tor`, you would create `content/training/resources/all-about-tor-guide/contents.lr`. Here's an example contents file for a training guide:

```
_model: resource
---
title: All About Tor Training Guide
---
author: Tor Project
---
cover:
---
background: white
---
image: /static/images/onion.png
---
body: body test goes here!

## Design

### The community-generator plugin

This lektor site uses a special plugin called `community-generator`, you can find it in the `packages` directory. This plugin generates a special set of lektor contents files used for a js-free filtering system on the training resources page.

You shouldn't need to do anything or know anything about this plugin in order to use it. If you want to develop on this plugin, see the plugin's [README](packages/community-generator/README.md).
