----
description:
- It's not advisable to change settings in the NoScript "options" menu.
- For example, adding sites to the "whitelist" can result in fingerprinting.
- Instead, only "temporarily trust" blocked objects, or use security slider (Standard, Safer, Safest)


#### slide ####
title: DuckDuckGo
----
description:
- DuckDuckGo is the default search engine in Tor Browser.
- Using Tor Browser prevents DDG from tracking users, even if they wanted to (they claim not to).
- Duckduckgo.com or <https://duckduckgogg42xjoc72x3sjasowoarfbgcmvfimaftt6twagswzczad.onion/>.

#### slide ####
title: Plugins, add-ons, JavaScript
----
description:
- Do not add any new add-ons/extensions to Tor, and don't enable any plugins.
  - For example, Flash plugin can reveal your real location. 
- JavaScript is enabled by default, but is sanitized to preserve anonymity.
